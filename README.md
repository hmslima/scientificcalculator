# Scientific Calculator

This is a simple scientific calculator made in HTML, JavaScript and CSS. My main objective with this project was to train my use of `Element.addEventListener()`, and how to deal with classes, but I learned some new things with the creation of this software.

Although this was rather a test of skills, I think that the program is good enough to be used in real situations, for I expect that even my smallest projects have some utility.
